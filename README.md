Classical ML Pipeline — Iris Species Classifier
A beginner-to-production sklearn workflow built as a hands-on exercise to consolidate core scikit-learn concepts:
preprocessing, pipelines, model training, and evaluation.

🎯 Project Purpose
This project demonstrates a complete classical ML workflow using scikit-learn — from raw data to a evaluated, production-style pipeline.
Built as part of the BITS Pilani AI & MLOps Engineering Program learning path, following foundational study of the scikit-learn library.

📁 Project Structure
├── README.md
└── iris_classifier.ipynb       # Main Colab notebook — full workflow

📊 Dataset
Iris Dataset — built into sklearn (sklearn.datasets.load_iris)

150 samples
4 input features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
3 target classes: Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica
No missing values — clean, focused dataset ideal for learning workflows


⚙️ Workflow
Raw Data
    ↓
Train / Test Split          (80% train, 20% test)
    ↓
StandardScaler              (scale numeric features)
    ↓
Logistic Regression         (train classifier)
    ↓
classification_report       (precision, recall, F1 per class)

🚀 How to Run

Open iris_classifier.ipynb in Google Colab
Run all cells in sequence
No additional installations required — all libraries are available in Colab by default


📈 Output
Running the notebook produces a classification_report showing:

Precision — of all predictions per class, how many were correct
Recall — of all actual samples per class, how many were caught
F1 Score — balance between precision and recall
Accuracy — overall correctness across all classes


🔑 Key Learning

A Pipeline chains preprocessing and model training into one deployable object.
fit() on training data. predict() on test data. The pipeline handles the rest.


🗺️ What's Next
This exercise is a stepping stone toward:

Custom preprocessors (MadeWithML CustomPreprocessor)
Multi-column preprocessing with ColumnTransformer
Text classification pipelines with TfidfVectorizer
Production ML with Ray / Anyscale (MadeWithML training module)
